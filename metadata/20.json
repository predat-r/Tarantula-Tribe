  "backstory": "With fur that shimmers like the twilight sky and eyes that reflect distant galaxies, this mystical being bridges the gap between our world and the cosmic unknown. Their elongated neck seems to reach toward the stars themselves, while their gentle smile holds secrets of celestial wonders. Fellow tribe members often find them in deep meditation, communing with forces beyond mortal understanding."
